## How to execute the Upload CSV App on your machine

Clone the project and access the project folder:
```bash
$ git clone 
$ cd upload-csv-app
```
To execute  Project locally follow the steps below:
```bash
# Install the dependencies for the back-end and the front-end
$ npm install

# To run the application
$ npm run dev

# To run all the tests including front-end and back-end
$ npm run test

```

## Just an observation
<p>
  When the command npm run dev is executed a extra localhost (http://localhost:5555/) will be opened, this localhost is the interface to interact and see the data stored in the SQLite database after the file being uploaded.
